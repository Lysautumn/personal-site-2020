        <p>
          I did not start my career as a Software Engineer. When I was young, I didn't think I was
          interested in, or good at, math and science. I earned an undergraduate degree in Political
          Science (a topic I'm still interested in) and a graduate degree in Public Administration.
          I worked in a few different industries while I waited for a job in my field and while deciding
          if I wanted to go back to school to earn a PhD, so I could be a professor.

          That's when I was introduced to code.

          Passionately Curious
        </h2>
        <p>
          A friend encouraged me to learn how to code, because I wasn't finding job opportunities
          I was excited about in my field. I wasn't sure if I would like it, but I didn't have anything
          to lose! That first day, I spent over 8 hours working through online resources on HTML and CSS.
          A whole new world opened up for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's when I realized that I earned a graduate degree because I love to learn. Working in tech
          gives me the opportunity to continue learning all the time. With endless things to learn and
          constant growth, I have found a way to be passionately curious in a career I love.

          Creative
        </h2>
        <p>
          In my free time, I like to do many things to fuel my creativity. Whether it's cooking,
          embroidery, painting, writing, or learning visual design, I enjoy finding new things
          to try.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing I love about tech is that I can blend together the challenges of logic and
          creativity. Blending these two things together allows me to create products I can be proud of.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I want to practice visual design, I work on challenges from&nbsp;

          Here's some of my past work:

          Quirky and Caffeinated
        </h2>
        <p>
          More often than not, you will find me with a coffee or tea in hand. I worked as a barista
          for many years and I love to find new coffee shops to visit. Know of any good ones? Let me know!
        </p>
        <p>
          The things I enjoy doing in my free time are wide-ranging. I enjoy playing board games
          and some video games (lately, I've been playing Animal Crossing: New Horizons on the Switch).
          I really love to read, even though I don't always have a lot of time to spend on it. I also
          like to watch documentaries and listen to podcasts. When the MN weather allows, I love to explore
          walking paths, find cool local businesses to support, and attend fun events like Art-A-Whirl, TC Pride Festival,
          and (of course) the MN State Fair.
